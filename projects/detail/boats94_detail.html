    <h2>the creation of the boats 94 mod</h2>
    <p class = "sectionp">nhl 94 is a game by EA that allows users to play as their favorite nhl teams
      <br><br>I modded the game to replace the hartford whalers with a local roller hockey team, boats 'n' hossas.
      <br><br>the game is programmed entirely using series of hex codes

    </p>
    <h3><a name = "motivation">Why would anyone make this?</a></h3>
    <p class = "sectionp">I made this fun little mod mostly for the enjoyment of the people on the team.
                  <br><br>It is fun to see how people translate from real-life to the video game.
                  <br><br>Thanks to the people who run <a href = "nhl94.com">nhl94.com</a>, the modding community's expertise is what made this possible</p>
    <h3><a name = "rosters">Making the roster</a></h3>
    <p class = "sectionp">Without a doubt the most enjoyable part of this whole process was adding the new roster and uniforms<br><br>
                          This is thanks to a tool called <a href = "https://forum.nhl94.com/index.php?/forum/18-nose/">NOSE</a> made by forum user wboy<br><br>
                          It makes editing all the information super easy, even providing a great GUI to make sure that everything is the way you want it<br><br>
                          After some ...creative rankings for each player on the team, the new players were in the game in less than a day.</p>
    <h3><a name = "images">Custom images</a></h3>
    <p class = "sectionp">The most time-consuming and frustrating part of the process was the images. Having only 16-bit color on the Genesis and a very limited<br><br>
                          memory meant that the developers had to get creative with how they put images in the game.<br><br>
                          Essentially, there is hex code that assigns a color id to each pixel and another block of hex code to map colors to color id's.<br><br>
                          The center-ice image was fairly easy to edit as detailed in <a href = "https://nhl94.com/html/editing/edit_bin.php#edit_bin_icelogos">this</a> guide, but the select screen logo caused some headaches<br><br>
                          This is because in order to save space, the developers of the game used only half of the hartford whalers logo (which is what I needed to edit) and had code to mirror it instead.<br><br>
                          It took me a while to figure out, and my disappointment was immesurable when I realized hartford was the only team with a symmetric logo in the entire game.<br><br>
                          After sorting that out, it was time to edit the player pictures on the team. Even though in the original game each team only had pictures for a select number of star players (to save on space)<br><br>
                          I wanted to have pictures for everyone on the team. To get around this, I identified the absolute worst teams in the game (other than hartford) and replaced their stars' pictures with my own,<br><br>
                          and after modifying the hex code to tell the game where the new pictures were, I was done. After ironing out a few bugs, the game booted up perfectly and ran better than I could've ever hoped for.<br><br>
