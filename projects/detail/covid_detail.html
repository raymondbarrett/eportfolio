    <h2>the creation of the covid cascade simulation</h2>
    <p class = "sectionp">The basic premise behind this simulation is quite simple and is based in the SEIR model.<br>
                          In the SEIR model, individuals go from being susceptible to exposed, infected and finally removed/recover.<br>
                          My model uses a large undirected graph to model the interaction between individuals in each of these stages.<br>
                          In theory,  if we could generate a large matrix A such that A(i,j) = A(j,i) = the chance of infection between nodes i and j,<br>
                          we can compute the vector multiplication of A by a column vector where each infected node is represented by a 1,<br>
                          and the resultant vector would be the probability of infection for each node.<br><br>
                          When algorithmically generating A, I tried to first use an approach that modeled concentric communities.<br>
                          I defined likelihoods of spread for individuals living in the same room, floor and building<br>
                          and I used available floor plans to approximate the shape of each building.<br>
                          I couldn't find reliable data on Greek housing so I approximated the number of people living in each house.<br>
                          The resulting matrix is 9056 x 9056, which is about accurate for the student population living on campus.<br><br>
                          However, residence halls are not the only way that the disease can spread.<br>
                          After generating the skeleton for our matrix, I pseudorandomly defined interpersonal communities.<br>
                          These represent classes, clubs, or just going somewhere with friends.<br>
                          The idea of distinct communities with links between them is often observed in real data<br>
                          and is how the known "6 degrees of separation" works.<br>
                          Finally, one additional row and column is added to the matrix. This node is connected to every node in the<br>
                          network and represents the probability that someone is infected by an individual outside of the residence halls.<br>
                          This node is always assumed to be positive.<br><br>
                          Once A is generated, we compute the multiplication of Ax, where x is a vector with 0's representing healthy individuals<br>
                          and 1's representing infectious individuals. This multiplication yields a vector of probabilities, where each<br>
                          value is the probability of that node is infected. After some random number generation, we calculate our new x vector<br><br>
                          Once nodes are infected, the removal code gets triggered. A pseudorandom number is generated representing testing/quarantine lag<br>
                          and it counts down each day. When it hits 0 the node is removed.<br><br>
                          The next steps for this project would be to allow for more dynamic shifting of the matrix A, but that has yet to be implemented.
