    <h2>machine learning music</h2>
    <p class = "sectionp">Machine learning music was a personal project based on <a href = "http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness">this</a> blog post.
      <br>I used <a href = "https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro">this</a> as my training data and converted it to midi with <a href = https://github.com/stephwag/midi-text>this</a> python script.
      <br>The final training data was ~600 million bytes long. i only had one night to train on a midrange gpu so it was just barely able to get through the entire data once.
    <br><br>the final midi file can be downloaded <a href = "../assets/downloads/MACHINE LEARNING.midi">here</a>, all source code is from the blog post above.</p>
