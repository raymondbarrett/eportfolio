    <h2>engineering complex networks</h2>
    <p class = "sectionp">engineering complex networks was a 3-week class through the engineering summer program at penn on graph theory
      <br><br>ecn focused on analyzing social networks to determine the most important nodes in the network
      <br><br>the final project was written in matlab and performed marginally better than outdegree centrality
