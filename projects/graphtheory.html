    <h2>engineering complex networks</h2>
    <p class = "sectionp">Engineering complex networks was a 3-week class through the Engineering Summer At Penn program on graph theory.
      <br><br>ECN focused on analyzing social networks to determine the most important nodes in the network.
      <br><br>The final project was written in matlab and performed marginally better than outdegree centrality.
    <br><br><br>Unfortunately, the source code has been lost to time. </p>
