    <h2>m3 challenge</h2>
    <p class = "sectionp">The mathworks math modeling (m3) challenge was a 14-hour programming challenge focused on modeling the adoption of electric trucks.
      <br>Our 3-person group worked to create both mathematical models and visual representations of said models.
      <br>I created the MATLAB implementation and visualization of our falling-marginal-cost model for adoption and a python simulation describing how electric trucks would move through a highway.
    <br><br>The source code is not publicly available</p>
