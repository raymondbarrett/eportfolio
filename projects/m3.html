    <h2>m3 challenge</h2>
    <p class = "sectionp">the mathworks math modeling (m3) challenge was a 14-hour programming challenge focused on modeling the adoption of electric trucks
      <br><br>our 3-person group worked to create both mathematical models and visual representations of said models
      <br><br>i created the matlab implementation and visualization of our falling-marginal-cost model for adoption and a python simulation describing how electric trucks would move through a highway
    <br><br><br>the source code is not publicly available</p>
