    <h2>broken physics simulation</h2>
    <p class = "sectionp">tried to create a convex rigidbody physics engine.
    <br><br>learned why people use physics engines. it doesn't work and is very broken
    <br><br>it trys to use GJK collision detection as described <a href = "https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/building-a-collision-engine-part-1-2d-gjk-collision-detection/">here</a>
    <br><br><br>if you want to see my broken code, it is <a href = "https://github.com/raymondbarrett/simulation">here</a></p>
