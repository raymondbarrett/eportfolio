    <h2>about me</h2>
    <h3>&emsp;Who I am</h3>
    <p class = "aboutmep">&emsp;Hi. My name is Raymond Barrett. I am currently pursuing a BS in Electrical Engineering at the Georgia Instite of Technology<br>
       &emsp;I have a background in software design and am trying to expand the scope of my knowledge to the hardware side.<br>
       &emsp;I really enjoy solving problems regarding efficiency and optimization.
    </p>
    <h3>&emsp;What I've done</h3>
    <p class = "aboutmep">&emsp;I have previously worked on various forms of machine learning including image recognition and recursive neural networks,<br>
       &emsp;and have some experience with graph theory and working graphs using software.<br>
       &emsp;I also have a little front-end development experience (like this website!) and<br>
       &emsp;a couple other smaller projects.<br>
       &emsp;Please check out the <a href = "projects">projects</a> page for more information on my past experiences.<br><br>
